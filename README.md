MIT xPro project I created on Week 2 of the course. It was an exercise to learn how to animate DOM elements and move them back and forth across the screen, detecting when they hit the edge of their bounding element and reversing direction/changing color.

## Instalation

Download the html file and run from your browser.

## Usage

Reference for future similar projects

## Roadmap

- Change the background color of the containing element
- Add more DOM elements
- Stop DOM elements with a mouse click
